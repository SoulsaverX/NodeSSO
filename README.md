# NodeStory - MapleStory server emulator for Node.js

**Work in progress!**

NodeStory is a MapleStory server emulator for the Node.js runtime. This is a hobby project to challenge myself as a backend developer and build upon my understanding of TypeScript and Node.js.

NodeStory will be taking a modern and SOLID approach for its architecture. My focus will be writing a maintainable server framework that allow developers to easily modify and extend functionalities.
